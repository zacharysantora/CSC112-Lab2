// This is a widget derivative which implements an application.
// An application widget is meant to act as the root widget for
// a program.  It doesnot draw anything itself, but rather handles
// that by drawing its child widget.
// The application widget is also responsible for gathering and
// dispatching keyboard and resize events.  It responds to these
// events by creating and passing event objects to its child 
// widget.
